“Format specifications” are used within replacement fields contained within a
format string to define how individual values are presented (see Format String
Syntax and Formatted string literals). They can also be passed directly to the
built-in format() function. Each formattable type may define how the format
specification is to be interpreted.

Most built-in types implement the following options for format specifications,
although some of the formatting options are only supported by the numeric types.

A general convention is that an empty format specification produces the same
result as if you had called str() on the value. A non-empty format specification
typically modifies the result.
